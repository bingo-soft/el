     * parameter is null, the resolver must enumerate the list of top-level variables it can
     * resolve. The Iterator returned must contain zero or more instances of
     * java.beans.FeatureDescriptor, in no guaranteed order. In the case of primitive types such as
     * int, the value null must be returned. This is to prevent the useless iteration through all

     * method and the {@link #getCommonPropertyType(ELContext, Object)} method should be used
     * instead. Each FeatureDescriptor will contain information about a single variable or property.
     * In addition to the standard properties, the FeatureDescriptor must have two named attributes
     * (as set by the setValue method):
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link #TYPE} - The value of this named attribute must be an instance of java.lang.Class

     * <li>{@link #RESOLVABLE_AT_DESIGN_TIME} - The value of this named attribute must be an
     * instance of java.lang.Boolean and indicates whether it is safe to attempt to resolve this
     * property at designtime. For instance, it may be unsafe to attempt a resolution at design time
     * if the ELResolver needs access to a resource that is only available at runtime and no
     * acceptable simulated value can be provided.</li>

     * even infinitely large set of properties. Care should be taken by the caller to not get stuck
     * in an infinite loop. This is a "best-effort" list. Not all ELResolvers will return completely
     * accurate results, but all must be callable at both design-time and runtime (i.e. whether or
     * not Beans.isDesignTime() returns true), without causing errors. The propertyResolved property
